## boss fight
hard if you using default combat and trying classick (hack and slash). Easy if you using counter attacks. You want to stay not very far from boss, otherwise Envy will use small circle aoe, which is easy to dodge but have little attack possibility. On the other hand, if you stay too close â€“ will be hard to notice staff swing. You want Envy to use staff as often as possible: easy to dodge and thus easy to counter. Also this attack have least damage output. Third Envy attack is large growing cirle aoe. Dont try to run away. Better run towards Envy and jump once he release aoe.
